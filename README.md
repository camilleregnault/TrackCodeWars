This is the GitHub repository where I save copies of the katas I've completed on [codewars.com](www.codewars.com).

## What is CodeWars?

It is an online dojo, where you can challenge yourself with kata to improve your skill and technique in any language.
Each kata on the site is set to a Kyu/Dan rank, based on its subject area and difficulty.

I mainly train myself for Ruby and Javascript challenges.

## List of challenges

### Ruby:

- Duplicate encoder
- Build Tower
- Array.diff
